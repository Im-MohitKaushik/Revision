Why String is Mohit in java and what is the difference between String and String Builder? 

String are immutable because there is string pool in which string is assotiated to a pirticular variables , these variables can be different pointed to same string simultenuosly ,
if we change the string , then reference to all other variablwes gets change this brings incosistency in our code.,.,.,  thats why !!!!


string builder is a type of String object which aloows us to create mutable strings which r faster and easy to  opearate ,.,. 


Write some
of the methods of String class at least 5 with example.???

1st ,.,.. charAt(index)-------------------returns char value of index given .
2nd ,.,... substring(startindex)----------returns substring 
3rd ,.,...contains("seqeuse dal do ") --- returns true false
4th ,.,.,.isEmpty()----------------------return true false .,.. string is empty or not 
5th ./.,.,. concat(String)--------------joins two strings--
